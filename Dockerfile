# not a published contract, so a future version could move it — and the first thing the container
# does at runtime is a migration, meaning a broken launcher would surface as what looks like a
# database failure rather than a missing file. Proving the CLI answers here turns that into an
# obvious, immediate build error instead. The dependency range is pinned to ^5 so a major
# reorganisation cannot arrive unreviewed in the first place.

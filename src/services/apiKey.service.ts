// ── The master API key (Phase 7.13a) ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This key is what every client presents to use the gateway. Until now it was the ONLY credential
// stored in plain text: provider keys are AES-encrypted, team keys are hashed, and the master key —
// the one that opens everything — sat readable in the database.
//
// It is hashed now, like the team keys it sits beside, and shown exactly once when it is generated
// or rotated. That is the trade Stripe, OpenAI and GitHub all make, and it is the honest one: a key
// the dashboard can show you again is a key a stolen database can show an attacker. What you get
// instead is a masked hint (enough to tell which key is live) and a Rotate button.
//
// sha256, not scrypt: this is a 256-bit value we generate, not a human-chosen password, so it is
// unguessable regardless — and the fast digest is what keeps verification a single cached read on
// the proxy hot path, where a memory-hard hash would be a self-inflicted denial of service.

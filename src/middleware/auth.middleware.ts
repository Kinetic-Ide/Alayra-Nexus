 *
 * Rule 3 is the point of two phases at once. If the password kept working as a bearer token after
 * 2FA was enabled, anyone holding it would bypass the second factor and the feature would be
 * decorative (Phase 6). And if it kept working once accounts existed, the audit trail would go back
 * to saying "password" instead of a name, and nobody could ever truly be offboarded (Phase 7.13a).
 * Both doors stay open until the operator closes them, so upgrading changes nothing on its own.

// ── Operator notifications: the pure core (Phase 6.4) ─────────────────────────
// Alerts an operator when the gateway is degrading or under attack, so they do not
// have to watch a dashboard to find out. This module is the decision half — the event
// catalogue, the config shape and its normalization, the human-readable message per
// event, and the coalescing key — all pure and unit-tested. The side effects (reading
// config, sending email/webhooks, the once-per-window guard in Redis) live in
// notifications.service. The delivery discipline is fire-and-forget: an email outage
// must never slow or fail a proxied request, so nothing here is ever on the request path.

/** The events an operator can be alerted on. The first three are rare failure or security
 *  signals tapped in the service layer; the last two (Phase 6.4b) are the request-path
 *  thresholds — a team crossing 80%/100% of its budget and a capability running out of
 *  usable keys (503). All are detected off, or fire-and-forget from, the hot path. */

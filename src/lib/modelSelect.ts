// ── Model-first selection (Phase 6.1) ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Routing used to walk *pools* by tier and take each pool's single `preferredModel`.
// That put the model on the credential, so one Anthropic key could serve exactly one
// model, and the Models tab that operators actually edit did not drive routing at all.
//
// Selection now walks *models*: the registry is the source of truth for which model
// runs, its tier, and its priority. A pool is reduced to what it always really was —
// a provider's base URL, auth, and keys. This module is the pure ordering step; the
// key/breaker/admission mechanics stay in nexus.service and are unchanged.

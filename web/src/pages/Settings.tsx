// is a sub-tab that loads and saves only what it owns. Nothing new was needed from the gateway —
// every endpoint behind these panels has existed and been tested since the 6.x phases and was simply
// never reachable from the redesigned dashboard.
//
// P7.7 moved the response-cache control out to its own Caching section (where it sits with the cache
// stats and purge), so there is one editor for it, not two.
